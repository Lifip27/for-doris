This is a simple html page customized with a calendar to remember all the little things...

I dont claim any credits on this

If you want to change make sure the photos are in /images/ and the namae coresponds to the day you want it to be.
Example: March 16 -> mar16.jpeg or .png whatever/

You have to do it manually this is not automated
